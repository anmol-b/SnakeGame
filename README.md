# Snake Game

This is a simple implmentation of the famous Snake game. This C++ application opens a simple console based UI and let's user play in a loop until they decide to quit.


To compile this use either g++ or gcc.

Example with g++:

```
g++ initialize.cpp Snake.cpp Utilities.cpp -o snake.exe
```
